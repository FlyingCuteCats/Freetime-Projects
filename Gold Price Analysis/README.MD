In THE last 2 years the direction of gold price is in reverse with the spread of US and CN 10y yield. A few exception happened in the first half of '22 and October '23.

The former is due to the surprised attack from Russia to Ukraine, and it led to a rise of risk aversion altogether. When the Gold price reverted to its January level about 2 months later, the spread appeared to hesitate before the hope of China ending zero-Covid policy diminished after May.

The latter is again due to another war, this time between Israel and Hamas. Again the gold could have begun its reversion in February, but China seemed to boost up accommodation by lowering its LPR in a largest-than-expected scale. This could support the rate of CNY and be positive for gold, at least in the short run.
